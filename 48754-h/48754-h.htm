<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="1">I</abbr><br />

<small>FIRST IMPRESSIONS</small></h2>


<p>Before entering upon the subject of this chapter
I cannot help a passing allusion to the lack of pictorial
records of this warâ€”records made by artists
of experience, who actually witness the scenes they
portray.</p>

<p>Our descendants will surely regret the omission
when they try to gather an impression of the
greatest war in history from the inadequate material
obtainable.</p>

<p>I do not lose sight of the fact that many professional
artists are fighting with our army in France
and elsewhere. But life in the trenches is so arduous
that it is doubtful if many records will come to us
from this source.</p>

<p>The start of my journey was not at all what I had
intended. I had imagined myself busily sketching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>our departure and attempting to get some of the
delightful colour and abundant movement of the
lower Thames.</p>

<p>In actual fact, I spent most of this time lying on
a settee, trying to overcome the effects of inoculation,
though rather cheered, it is true, by the thought of
the annoyance set up amongst the millions of germs
inhabiting my system.</p>

<p>I made several efforts to go on deck, but was
forced each time to give in and return to my cabin.</p>

<p>This was the more annoying, as we were passing
through what to any traveller by sea, and to me
especially, was the most interesting zone: full of
romance and mystery, with stories of sunken submarines,
rumours of nets and mines, and all the
strange happenings of this strangest of wars.</p>

<p>There was naturally a certain amount of speculation
on the steamer as to the possibility of attack
by submarine: this new factor in modern warfare,
which, from a romantic point of view, has so
largely conduced to the elimination of spectacular
fighting.</p>

<p>At the time of sailing we had heard of submarine
activity in the western entrance to the
Channel, though the apparent indifference of the
passengers was a wonderful testimony to the calmness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>of the Briton in the presence of a very real
danger. However, hopes ran fairly high that we
might soon get into safe waters, as we were favoured
with a fairly heavy summer gale, which should,
with luck, see us well round Ushant and down the
bay.</p>

<p>We were pushing along doing a steady ten knots
with our fore-deck frequently taking it green; but,
well loaded as we were with general cargo, the ship
was wonderfully easy in motion. This was in comforting
contrast to a tramp-steamer close by, which
looked as if she wanted to see how far she could roll
without turning over.</p>

<p>Ships bound for the Mediterranean and to other
parts are more scattered nowadays than formerly.
Since the war they have avoided the recognised trade
routes. Probably there may be enemy submarines
bound out to the Eastern Mediterranean, but the
likelihood of attack from these appeared to us small.
After all, they would surely reserve their stock of
torpedoes for a more important quarry, and, in any
case, would hardly be likely to advertise their
presence before arriving in their intended zone of
operations.</p>

<p>During the night we passed a number of patrol
boats keeping their ceaseless vigil. The patrol
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>service will, when the war is over, undoubtedly reap
the full meed of praise to which they are entitled.
It is utterly impossible for the landsman to grasp the
soul-wearying work on patrol vessels. Frequently of
quite small tonnage, keeping the seas in every kind
of weather, not bound anywhere in particular, but
just slogging to and fro on a set beat, rarely thought
of except by the relatives and friends of those serving
in them.</p>

<p>We reached Gibraltar in two or three days, during
which time no alarms from submarines disturbed our
peace. The sight of the Rock for the first time must
frequently call forth an exclamation on the strangeness
of events which have enabled us to take and
hold so fine a strategical position. Isolated as it is
from any other of our possessions, it has certainly
served us well in the Dardanelles campaign.</p>

<p>Malta was made in the early morning, and it
certainly looked a gem set in a sea of opal, although
closer acquaintance found it stiflingly hot. Our time
here was short, as we were ordered to a vessel leaving
early next morning for Mudros, the base in the
island of Lemnos. The ship in which we took
passage was one of an entirely new class, specially
designed for the destruction of submarines. On our
passage up, a matter of three days, a sharp lookout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>was kept, as we were now nearing the danger zone.
For some reason difficult to discover there appeared
to be a lull in the operations of these craft, due, probably,
to the numerous devices employed to restrict
their activities. Nevertheless, continual reports were
coming in of their being sighted, and our Captain
was anxious to try the efficacy of his means of offence,
but we were disappointed or otherwise, according to
our various temperaments, for we sighted nothing
suspicious.</p>

<p>On the third day a French destroyer, with whom
we exchanged recognition signals, steamed up to us
for a closer inspection. This denoted our close
proximity to the great naval base from which the
operations in this theatre of war were largely conducted.</p>

<p>A distant view of Mudros, one of the finest natural
harbours in the eastern Mediterranean, showed a vast
concourse of ships, which grew in interest and numbers
as we approached. Eventually we steamed between
lines of warships to an anchorage given us by signal.
I have seen many reviews and naval pageants, but
nothing to compare, in interest, with the assemblage
of ships that we now witnessed. British battleships,
French battleships, cruisers of both nations; a Russian
cruiser, the <i>Askold</i> (which had incidentally been badly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>hammered in the war with Japan); destroyers, torpedo
boats of all ages, submarines (some fresh with the
laurels of raids in the Sea of Marmora), North
Sea trawlers, tramp-steamers, transports, food-ships,
motor-boats, Greek sailing vessels, motor-barges
for landing troops, private yachts taken over by
the Admiralty (the Admiral conducting operations
being himself in one of these), and endless other
craft gathered from everywhere to assist in the
enormous undertaking of supplying food and
munitions and to guard the routes to the various
other bases established in the islands around.
Towering above all the vessels could be seen the
<i>Aquitania</i> and the <i>Mauretania</i>, their immense bulk
dwarfing every ship in the harbour.</p>

<p>Ashore were camps in every direction, that of the
French being the most conspicuous, as, owing to its
longer occupation, the ground had lost every trace of
vegetation and had become a vast arid mound,
looking terribly hot, with clouds of sand blowing
continually across it.</p>

<p>The fact of so many battleships and cruisers being
in the harbour was an eloquent tribute to the moral
influence of submarines. These craft would appear to
have been less active recently, whether as a result of
means taken to combat them (the sea is a maze of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>nets), or whether from engine troubles or shortage of
petrol, it is impossible to say. On the other hand,
they may hope to lull us into a sense of false security,
and thus to entice the larger ships out. Whatever
the cause, our belief in their inactivity is strengthened
by the fact that a number of warships are patrolling
the seas continually without interference.</p>

<p>We spent a few days in this port before an opportunity
occurred to get nearer to the area of hostilities.
I was fortunate enough to be appointed to a ship
which left almost immediately for Kephalo, our base
in the island of Imbros, some ten miles distant from
the enemy coast. After a rapid passage through a sea
studded with indicator nets, we arrived at Kephalo.
A fair enough anchorage, this, in summer, though
a practically continuous breeze from the north-east,
sometimes of considerable strength, is apt to make it
uncomfortable for small craft.</p>

<p>The setting here is rather more picturesque than
Mudros, by reason of the smaller water area and
higher hills on the northern side. Here again a
large concourse of ships was gathered, mostly transports,
though two vessels, the balloon-spotting ship
<i>Hector</i> and the plane-carrying and repair ship <i>Ark
Royal</i>, were of unusual interest. The flagship
<i>Exmouth</i>, with a large collier made fast on either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>beam, was evidently determined not to allow the
marauding submarine any opportunity of repeating
her <i>Majestic</i> and <i>Triumph</i> successes.</p>

<p>Nothing has been left undone to make Kephalo
a safe anchorage. A complete net-guard stretched
across the harbour has up to the present been effective
in preventing submarine attack.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="2">II</abbr><br />

<small>THE LANDING AT SUVLA BAY, AUGUST 6-7</small></h2>


<p>The strictest secrecy was maintained with regard
to the new landing in Gallipoli, thus preventing
anything but the vaguest rumours leaking out as to
the point chosen for disembarkation. It was presumed
that the Turks must have taken every possible
protective measure to guard against surprise. I was
very fortunate in being attached to the ship which
the Admiral conducting operations had chosen as his
temporary flagship.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give any idea of the strange
feelings that possessed us as we crept through the
darkness on the night of August 6, knowing that
big events loomed ahead. Would it be a surprise
to the enemy? Had they any information of our
movements? A single bright light showing on the
northerly end of Imbros looked suspiciously like a
signal to the Turks, a simple matter when one
realised that our bases in these islands were held
entirely on sufferance and we had practically no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>jurisdiction over spies. Our occupation of the
various islands was somewhat Gilbertian; after the
war between Turkey and Greece both parties claimed
the islands in the Ã†gean, neither being in a position
to hold them successfully. Consequently, when the
Dardanelles operations commenced, we naturally
decided to regard the islands as "No Man's Land,"
although the Greeks knew that, in the event of a
successful campaign, we should probably hand them
over to their keeping. It is certain that without
them we could never have carried on the operations
in this theatre of war.</p>

<p>We left the anchorage of Kephalo with every
light obscured and silence enjoined, even white
clothes and cigarettes being forbidden on deck. It
was fortunately a dark night even for these parts.
At slow speed with a picket-boat close on our
quarter we crept across the twelve miles separating
us from Suvla Bay, which by now was generally
presumed to be the place chosen for what we hoped
would be a surprise landing. Two cruisers, the
<i>Theseus</i> and <i>Endymion</i>, carrying large numbers of
men, and specially fitted with gangways over their
sterns to allow the troops to walk down into motor-lighters,
were sent on with destroyers towing
motor-lighters full of troops to be at the point of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>disembarkation at about 11.30 p.m. We on the
flagship steered a slightly more northerly course, in
order not to interfere with these vessels in the
darkness, and arrived in Suvla Bay at about
12.30 a.m.</p>

<p>The fact that the landing had already begun was
shown by desultory rifle-fire from the shore, but of
so spasmodic a character that a feeling of hope arose
that the surprise was complete. Impatience now
became general for the first gleam of daylight.
After an apparently endless wait the dawn began to
make in the eastern sky, and there was enough light
to get some idea of the general state of affairs.</p>

<p>On C beach the troops had landed from the
cruisers and destroyers in the darkness with practically
no opposition. A beautiful sandy shore,
sloping at sufficiently steep an angle to allow the
motor-lighters to beach without difficulty, facilitated
the landing. The troops, dashing forward, were able
to penetrate inland and drive the small bodies of
Turks out of their trenches. They then advanced
over the now dry salt lake some considerable
distance.</p>

<p>On A beach things were not so successful. Here,
a shallow ridge of sand, running parallel to the shore,
held up three of the motor-lighters carrying some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>1500 men at a point where wading was impossible,
owing to the deeper water inside the ridge. Here
the men were subjected to considerable rifle-fire from
bodies of Turkish troops and suffered a number of
casualties. Picket-boats, however, succeeded in taking
them off and landing them on the beach.</p>

<p>By this time it was possible to see more plainly
what was taking place. Two batteries of Turkish
field-guns opened fire with shrapnel and high
explosives on the landing-parties and on the three
lighters which were firmly fixed on the sand reef.
The lighters specially claimed the attention of the
enemy's guns, doubtless under the impression that
they still contained troops. Beyond the lighters
large numbers of men could be seen filing along the
beach, or forming up, and amongst these, large
columns of sand and dust showed where the shells
pitched, causing many casualties.</p>

<p>At about five o'clock an enemy aeroplane was
sighted, but so occupied was everyone with the
work in hand that practically no attention was
paid to her; and shortly after, four large bombs
were dropped in quick succession in the harbour,
causing huge columns of discoloured water to rise,
but doing no damage to the shipping, which by
now had grown in numbers. Five fleet sweepers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>arrived bringing large numbers of men, who were
landed rapidly to support those already ashore, and
as quickly disappeared into the scrub beyond the
beach. The <i>Talbot</i> and <i>Chatham</i> were now busy
with their 6-inch guns driving back those Turks
who still endeavoured to oppose our landing. The
<i>Talbot</i> by a few well-placed shots entirely disposed
of a battery which had considerably annoyed us
during the early part of the operations. It was
impossible now to see exactly what was taking place,
as the low-lying land, over which the troops were
advancing, was hidden by sand dunes from the
harbour.</p>

<p>By now large transports were arriving with more
troops and stores, and a battery of field artillery was
landed and quickly galloped into a position on Lalla
Baba, where they could give good support to the
advance.</p>

<p>A slight description of the country in which this
attempt to straddle the peninsula was taking place
may be of interest, as seen from the sea. On our
left Suvla Point, with Nebruniessi Point to the right,
formed a small bay known as Suvla Bay some mile
and a half across. To the right of Nebruniessi Point
a long gently curving sandy beach some four or
five miles in extent terminated where the Australian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>position at Anzac rose steeply to the Sari Bair range. Inside
and immediately in front of us was a large
flat sandy plain covered with scrub, while the dry
salt lake showed dazzlingly white in the hot morning
sun. Immediately beyond was Chocolate Hill, and
behind this again lay the village of Anafarta some
four miles from the shore. As a background, the
Anafarta ridge ran from the village practically
parallel with the sea until it took a sharp turn due
west to Suvla Point, where it gradually sloped down
to the coast. Beyond the plain in front of us a
number of stunted oaks, gradually becoming more
dense further inland, formed excellent cover for the
enemy's snipersâ€”a mode of warfare at which the
Turk has become an adept.</p>

<p>By climbing into the foretop of the vessel, it
was possible to watch the living cinema of battle.
Glasses were necessary to distinguish the light khaki
of our men against the scrub and sand. The troops
marching in open order across the salt lake formed
a most stirring picture as they crossed the unbroken
surface of silver-white. Overhead shrapnel burst
unceasingly, leaving small crumpled forms on the
ground, one or more of which would slowly rise
and walk shorewards, while others lay where they
fell. Beyond this open space it became almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>impossible to follow the movements of the battle,
but the continual rattle of musketry showed where
the advance was proceeding into the more thickly
wooded plain. Our hopes that the surrounding
ridges would be taken before nightfall were unfortunately
not realised. The enemy, though not in
great strength to commence with, were continually
reinforced, while the broken nature of the ground
made anything like perfect cohesion amongst our
various units extremely difficult. To make matters
still worse, the enemy's shells caused dense bush
fires, which, driven by the wind, burst into sheets
of flame. Great difficulty was experienced in dealing
with snipers. Officers and men were continually shot
down, not only by rifle fire from advanced posts of
the enemy, but by men and even women behind our
own firing-line. The particular kind of tree in this
part, a stunted oak, lends itself peculiarly to concealment,
being short with dense foliage. Here, a
sniper would lurk with face painted green and so
well hidden as to defy detection. Others would
crouch in the dense brushwood, where anyone passing
could be shot with ease. When discovered, these
snipers had in their possession enough food and
water for a considerable period as well as an ample
supply of ammunition. Although this seems a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>murderous kind of warfare, there is no question as
to the pluck of the sniper, of whatever nationality,
for he has little chance of getting back to his comrades
and small likelihood of quarter if caught.</p>

<p>Water, or rather the want of it, was a serious bar
to our progress in the initial stages. Those who
formed the first landing-parties carried provisions
and water for forty-eight hours; but in a country of
this nature and under a boiling sun it is naturally
impossible to convince the young soldier fighting in a
temperature he has never experienced before, of the
necessity of husbanding his water supply. So it
proved in this instance. The advanced troops were
completely exhausted by thirst. Could this have
been remedied at once it is certain a different tale
would have been told.</p>

<p>The question which now arose amongst those
who were conducting the naval side of the operations
was, how long would the Turkish guns allow the shipping
to remain in the harbour (it became a harbour,
theoretically, as soon as the steamer detailed for the
work had laid submarine defence nets).</p>

<p>The bay was now thickly crowded with shipping,
including such tempting bait as big transports full of
troops, store-ships, and every kind of vessel which
goes to the support of an army. Yet, fortunately, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>were only subjected to intermittent shell-fire, the
Turks probably experiencing some difficulty in getting
guns into position in addition to those required
against the troops.</p>

<p>It was not until the 12th August that any serious
action was taken by the enemy against the ships in
harbour. On that day the vessels inside the defence
net consisted of a large monitor lying close in
shore, several smaller monitors at intervals off the
beach, the <i>Cornwall</i>, <i>Chatham</i>, and <i>Swiftsure</i>, and a
number of transports and storeships. The <i>Swiftsure</i>
was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Christian, who
conducted the naval side of the operations.</p>

<p>Shortly after midday the Turks opened fire on the
monitor <i>Havelock</i>. The range was good, but the
first shells were ineffective, though they fell close
round her. As she was lying at anchor, and things
were becoming rather uncomfortable, she weighed
and was just moving when a shell burst on the upper
deck behind the funnel, without, however, doing
serious damage. The enemy's gunners realising now
that their chances of hitting the <i>Havelock</i> were
small, turned their attention to the <i>Swiftsure</i>.
The latter, surrounded as she was by picket-boats
and lighters, found it difficult to get under weigh
quickly. Several of us were standing on the quarter-deck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>of the flagship when the shells began to come in
our direction. The first shell pitched some fifty
yards short; the next passed overhead, falling fairly
close to our port side. They had our range to a
nicety. The probability that the third would hit us
caused a hurried exodus below deck, where, although
the protection afforded was not great, one felt a sense
of security which was perhaps more theoretical than
practical. Almost immediately the heavy thud of a
projectile outside the ward-room told us that our
judgment was not far wrong. Fortunately this failed
to explode, and was afterwards picked up on the net
shelf. Another entered the ship's side close to the
padre's cabin, and, going through three steel partitions,
brought up in the petty officers' pantry, where
a peaceful domestic was engaged in washing-up.
Fortunately for him this also failed to explode.
Immediately afterwards three high explosive shells
came inboard on the upper deck, and bursting there
killed 7 men and wounded 16. Curiosity in this
case had overcome a sense of prudence, for they had
been watching the enemy's attempt to drive us out of
the harbour.</p>

<p>The numerous picket-boats, lighters, etc., had
now left us, so we were able to get weigh on the
ship. We slowly steamed in a circle without going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>outside the defence net, in case a submarine might
be lying in wait as part of a preconceived plan.
The fact that we had moved from our former billet
was sufficient to stop the enemy's fire, as practically
all his guns were field artillery, making it almost
impossible to follow a moving object with the
accuracy of a naval gun.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to attempt any elaborate
description of the land operations, as it was very
difficult to obtain really reliable news. Moreover,
after the first few days, the Turks had succeeded in
bringing up a number of fresh troops and artillery,
and were strongly entrenched. It was increasingly
evident, therefore, that, unless a very large body of
men could be brought up the advance had virtually
ceased and resolved itself into a digging-in competition.
Up till now the Turks had made no
concerted effort to drive us out; but one night, at
about eight o'clock, a heavy bombardment suddenly
commenced on the left flank, which lasted about an
hour and a half. The sky was lit by hundreds of
bursting shrapnel, high explosives and star shells:
the prelude, presumably, to an attack in force. From
our position in the bay it certainly looked as if a
big fight were in progress, and a great deal of speculation
was rife on the ships in harbour as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>outcome. About 9.30 a signal arrived from the
Headquarters 9th Army Corps, saying "Situation
well in hand." It appeared, for some reason unknown
to us, that the enemy had entirely failed to follow
up the bombardment and attack. Indeed, as far as
could be ascertained, not a single Turk had left the
trenches, and we afterwards learned from deserters
that even flogging and threats had failed to move
them.</p>

<p>After this, day succeeded day with a desultory
artillery duel morning and evening, the afternoons
being presumably spent by the Turks in a siesta.
Little was accomplished by the artillery fire, beyond
the annoyance caused by shells falling amongst the
stores and dug-outs at the bases. It was astonishing
to see high explosive shells bursting in what appeared
to be crowded areas and to learn afterwards
from the soldiers that comparatively few casualties
had resulted. Certainly, at times, a shell would
cause considerable damage, especially if it fell on
rock or hard earth: one of these killed and wounded
upwards of 100 mules, and another, which I saw,
killed 9 men and wounded 7; but these were exceptions.
The Red Cross dressing stations had been
shelled in the early days of the landing, as, owing
possibly to the restricted area held by us, or more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>probably to carelessness and want of thought, large
quantities of stores and ammunition were landed
close to the dressing stations. These suffered considerably
in consequence from shell-fire. This was
not a deliberate act, as no nation could possibly have
conducted warfare in a more above-board and clean-handed
manner than the Turks. The fact that such
qualities could be attributed to the Turk was a
surprise to me, though naval officers generally have
long regarded him as the gentleman of the Eastern
Mediterranean. This is further borne out by his
reported refusal to use poisonous gas when attacking.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the landing the Turks sent
in an emissary to say that the Red Cross stations
would be respected provided no stores were landed
in the vicinity. Also at a later date the Turkish
Headquarters made a helio to the effect that they
had seen tows of boats communicating between warships
and the dressing stations. This they very
naturally resented, and said it must cease or they
would feel compelled to open fire. In another case
a surgeon told me that the enemy had actually sent
to apologise to him for the accidental shooting of one
of his stretcher-bearers. All this is, of course, only
what one would expect from a chivalrous enemy.
So brutally, however, have many of the theoretical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>usages of war been violated that the action of the
Turk stands out in bright contrast, and shows that
this much-maligned race retains a sense of honour
which seems to be lacking in others who claim the
right to lead the world in this direction.</p>

<p>The Turkish prisoners taken by us were few
in number. Many were farmers whose one wish
appeared to be to see the end of the war. After all,
when one remembers that the Turk has always been
friendly to the British, it is not surprising that in
fighting against us he should still retain a good deal
of his old feeling. At the same time he is fighting
in defence of his own country, and is regarded by
all who know him as never so effective as when on
the defensive. All one hears and reads of dissension
amongst the Turkish and German officers may be
true, as no doubt the German officer has taken a high
hand in his dealings with the Turkish Army. At
the same time the Turk is not so blind but that
he realises, to the full, the value of the German
as a teacher of the latest methods and devices of
warfare.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="3">III</abbr><br />

<small>OFF THE LEFT FLANK AT HELLES</small></h2>


<p>Shortly after my arrival I was appointed to a
ship engaged in bombarding enemy gun positions
and trenches off the left flank of the army at Helles.
To those unacquainted with warships perhaps a short
description of the ship may be of interest, though I
cannot of course enter into an exhaustive account of
our particular form of defence which has been evolved
through the advent of the submarine. The ship I
joined is known in the Navy, since her re-incarnation,
as a "blister" ship. She belongs to the <i>Blake</i> and
<i>Blenheim</i> type, which were in their day the finest
cruisers turned out by any naval power; handsome
vessels, good sea-boats, and generally a crack class;
but on the outbreak of hostilities they were a back
number and practically ready for the ship-breaker.
One of the surprises of this war, however, has been
the amount of active work done by the older vessels,
many of them good enough ships, though not fit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>lie in the battle-line, but excellent for bombardment
purposes, for which they have been extensively used.
Amongst these the cruiser I have mentioned came in
for special protective treatment. Since the German
submarine had driven our battle fleet into protective
harbours, and the Army must be supported at any
cost, a scheme for rendering these vessels proof
against the torpedo had to be devised. Torpedo
nets had failed in the case of the <i>Triumph</i>, and
were apt to render a ship extremely unhandy in the
event of the enemy batteries successfully getting the
range.</p>

<p>The first day on which the ship saw any action
we left Kephalo at nine o'clock in the morning to
relieve the <i>Endymion</i>, our sister-ship on the left flank,
each of us doing forty-eight hours on patrol and
forty-eight in harbour. I must say my feelings
were somewhat strange at being actually on a
war vessel for the first time about to come under
fire.</p>

<p>Impressions of this kind have been described so
often that I feel nothing in the way of a pen-picture
can give readers any new idea of the sensation. My
own feelings were a strange mixture of a desire to
get under some really effective cover and a wish to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>see the fall of our own shot on the enemy's position.
Our first taste was at a range which enabled one to
get a fair warning of the approach of the enemy's
shell. One heard first the distant bang of the gun,
followed almost immediately by a long whine which
grew in crescendo until the shell hit the water with
a loud plop. In the case of shrapnel this exploded
generally very short of us, leaving a round ball of
white smoke suspended in the air for some moments,
the bullets generally striking the sea some fifty yards
ahead of the burst. The shells which straddled the
ship were the most trying, as the sound of a projectile
passed right overhead, and seemed as if it
must be coming inboard. The long range (most of
the shell-fire being 12 or 15 <abbr title="pounder">pr.</abbr>) made the danger
problematical, as the angle of descent was very steep.
On the other hand, should we be hit, the shell was
likely to fall on our unarmoured decks. In the case
of several ships comparatively small shells had caused
damage in this way out of all proportion to the size
of the projectiles: in one instance a shell came inboard
on the <i>Grafton</i> between the foremast and
funnel, and bursting there, killed 9 and wounded
17 men.</p>

<p>The general consensus of opinion on board was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>that the Turks only fired when fired on, which went
some way to allay apprehension. Our first day out
certainly confirmed this idea, for it was not until we
had fired a number of rounds that any reply came
from the shore, and that of so desultory a nature as
to cause us little worry. At about five in the afternoon
one of our seaplanes came out to observe and
spot our fall of shot; this was the only way in
which any accurate results could be obtained.
While off the coast we were practically at the
disposal of the military, who informed us when any
Turkish batteries caused them particular annoyance.
They would then signal to us the position on which
they wished the shells to be fired.</p>

<p>The procedure was of some interest, as the
shooting which we were required to do was of a
somewhat novel kind for naval guns. With very
few exceptions, where the objective could be seen,
the target was only one of many concealed batteries.
On one occasion as many as 800 Turkish shells
were fired in a comparatively short space of time
from the Asiatic shore on to Helles beach, although
the total casualties, due to the wonderful system
of dug-outs, were only three mules killed and two
men wounded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>The hour chosen for our practice on the enemy's
gun emplacements was, as a rule, late in the afternoon,
by which time the sun was directly behind
us and showed up every formation of the coast. At
about the time appointed one or other of the lookouts
would report "Aeroplane in sight, sir," and shortly
afterwards one shot would be fired, or possibly three,
to give the aeroplane something to work on. The
range, usually about 8000 yards, was arrived at by
the navigator, who, knowing our own distance from
the coast to a yard, would then use the squared map
of the peninsula on which every known Turkish
battery was marked, and add to it the distance
inland of the particular battery, taking for a point
of aim some feature on the land, the ship being
stationary.</p>

<p>The most interesting place on the ship while
firing was in progress was "Monkey Island." This
is the platform above the chart-house used in ordinary
times for navigation and from which a clear all-round
view can be obtained. It was surrounded by a thick
protection of canvas packed with cotton-waste, rope,
and other odds and ends to render it proof at least
against shrapnel and rifle bullets, whilst overhead a
thick mat was suspended for the same purpose. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>is from this position that the directions are handed
on to the guns by voice-pipe from the control
on the foremast, where the gunnery lieutenant is
stationed.</p>

<p>Soon after the first shot is fired, the tinkle of a
bell can be heard. This is the telephone from the
wireless-room, where the aeroplane's spotting correction
has been received, and the Captain's voice is
heard at the voice-pipe from the conning-towers to
the fire-control, giving the gunnery officer the correction.
Assuming the aeroplane's signal to have been,
say, 200 short 50 left, the gunnery lieutenant then
gives the corrected range via "Monkey Island" to
the guns, or whichever particular gun he wishes to
use. The message is handed on by a boy to the
gun below, and there repeated by one of the gun's
crew back to the fire-control in confirmation. A
moment's pause, and the order "Fire" is again
given. Immediately a sheet of bright orange flame,
and an ear-splitting crash are followed by a vibrating
rush of the shell through the air, gradually dying
down to a distant sigh. Then just over our point
of aim a dirty yellowish cloud rises slowly, showing
roughly the spot on which our shell has fallen. At
last, after possibly four or five shots, the aeroplane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>makes the signal "O K," showing that one of our
shots has got home in the gun emplacement, and
rapid fire opens from all guns which bear on the side
engaged.</p>

<p>An instance of the unfailing supply of the lighter
side of things was afforded one day when the ship
was under fire from Turkish batteries. Everyone
was under cover more or less, though it is a very
difficult matter to get men who have never been
under fire to take cover adequately. The human is a
curious animal when he wants to see what is happening,
and, as a rule, it was not until a ship had been
badly hit and men killed or wounded that the
necessity to seek cover seemed to be taken to heart.
On the occasion already mentioned the Turks were
doing some very good shooting, and a fairly large
high-explosive shell burst on the water close to us on
the starboard side just abaft the bridge. A large
number of shell fragments came inboard, scattering
groups of men, who were watching events, without
injuring any of them. Their hurried flight caused
much hilarity amongst the gun-layers and others
already in cover, but any sense of fear on the part of
those so dispersed rapidly gave place to a desire to
collect souvenirs in the shape of shell-splinters. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>piece of shell which has actually come aboard your
own ship while you are in her possesses a value to
the finder which is peculiarly personal. Consequently
the fo'c's'le and waist of the ship immediately became
a hunting ground for eager collectors; and as most
people know the amount of gear on a ship's deck, it
will be understood that there were possibilities of a
find in a variety of places. However, the first men
on the scene rapidly collected all that could be found,
and a large number sought in vain for a memento of
the occasion. Amongst these was a member of the
crew whose late arrival precluded any chance of
finding souvenirs, but whose brain was not slow
in supplying a substitute for the much-sought-after
booty. Every warship carries a blacksmith's forge,
and scattered about in its vicinity are nearly always
to be found a number of small pieces of iron of all
shapes and sizes, many of them remarkably like
shell-splinters. The late-comer quickly turned his
attention to these, and, making a rapid collection of
the most likely looking fragments, he joined the still
eager searchers. Presently, as the enthusiasm waned
for want of spoil, he produced a number of deadly
looking fragments, some of which he gave to empty-handed
shipmates, while others he parted with for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>small sums. These are now probably looked upon in
sundry homes as the "bit o' shell that nearly wiped
out poor Bill."</p>

<p>I suppose active service always brings with it
periods of dullness and monotony, when any little
incident like the foregoing is welcomed with relief.
Another event of this kind which seems to me worth
recounting caused a good deal of amusement at the
time.</p>

<p>On our ship there was a small coterie of non-executive
officers, whose particular duties were not
called into use when the ship was under fire. The
novelty of being fired at having worn off, and the
danger of unnecessarily exposing oneself realised,
they decided, after interrogating sundry experts on
the subject, that the safest place in the ship, short
of the indignity of descending below the armoured
deck, was the gun-room. We carried no midshipmen,
so that the gun-room was occupied only by
one or two warrant officers whose duty, during
action, mostly lay on deck. It was here, therefore,
that the aforesaid coterie gathered as soon as we
came under fire, to indulge in a quiet game of bridge.
The prolonged immunity of this particular spot from
shell-fire had lulled into a sense of security any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>feelings of apprehension as to the likelihood of a
shell finding its way there, the more so as it was
not only on the lower deck but on the disengaged
side. But the joyful band of card-players received
a severe shock. Firing had been in progress for
some time, and a few shells of the enemy had pitched
near the ship while a game of bridge was in full
swing. Suddenly a terrific crash on the starboard
side, followed by a big explosion, denoted the arrival
of a shell in their immediate vicinity. It had
penetrated the side exactly opposite the gun-room,
and, bursting, fortunately in a store-room (thus to
some extent localising the damage), hurled several
large fragments through the open door into the midst
of the players without actually touching one of them.
The luckiest escape was that of an officer who was
standing in the doorway at the time leaning with
one hand high up on the side of the entrance. A
fragment of shell passed beneath his arm close over
the heads of the players and buried itself in the
casing on the inside of the ship. The whole flat
outside was filled with dust and dÃ©bris, and it was
some moments before the occupants could get sufficiently
sorted out to realise that no injuries had been
received. Needless to say, this rude disturbance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>caused a somewhat hurried exit from the "safest"
place in the ship, and great was the chaff which had
to be endured by the erstwhile inhabitants, the more
so as this was the only hit scored by the enemy on
that day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="4">IV</abbr><br />

<small>TRAWLERS IN THE DARDANELLES</small></h2>


<p>The work of the trawlers in the Dardanelles
demands special mention. The men running these
vessels are in the majority of cases elderly, and the
ships themselves were never intended to come under
fire; yet these men have constantly been in very
hot places, and have gone there knowing what was
in store for them.</p>

<p>The ships have been used for every conceivable
kind of work. They have carried stores, troops,
mails and munitions. They have been engaged in
mine-sweeping, patrolling and towing nets. They
have tackled the elusive submarine; in fact, they
have done everything that can be thought of short
of bombarding forts, and they would cheerfully take
this job on if required. Here is the typical day
of a trawler during general ferry work, on which
I took passage.</p>

<p>We left Kephalo early in the morning, calling
first at Anzac, then at Helles; from there to Rabbit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Island and Tenedos; back to Helles, and, if required,
to Anzac again. Generally from Helles this trawler
would go direct to Kephalo. The round is seventy
odd miles. Every morning on starting, the skipper
knew the ship would come under shell-fire at Anzac
almost without fail, as the anchorage is commanded
by the Turkish guns, and any sign of movement,
or of ships arriving or leaving, invariably
brought its accompaniment of shells. I gathered
from him that this had been his daily lot for four
months.</p>

<p>He was a fine type of North Sea skipper, and
took everything as it came with a stoicism which was
admirable. He didn't like itâ€”nobody does; but
it was his job, and there was an end of it!</p>

<p>The day on which I took passage with him was
typical of all the others. We left Kephalo at seven
in the morning, the sun well up and already hot,
blue sky, blue sea and a very light breeze. Anzac,
our first port of call, showed up clearly some twelve
miles off, standing out, by reason of its distinctive
character, from the rest of the coast. Rising between
the flat sandy beachesâ€”C beach and Brighton
beachâ€”it looked as if the Sari Bair range had suddenly
been chopped off or slipped into the sea.
Here were no foot-hills sloping gently to the coast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>but abrupt sandstone precipices looking very unfinished
in the brilliant morning light.</p>

<p>The fact that our reception, of which I had
already been warned, would be as usual, was borne
out on nearing the coast. The Anzac water-steamer,
lying some 3000 yards out waiting for lighters to
come off, attracted the attention of the enemy. When
we got fairly close to her we heard a distant bang,
which told us the Turks were awake. Now a gun
being fired at you is unmistakable and quite different
from one of your own guns, though the latter may
be much louder. In this case, although only a second
or two intervened between the report and the splash
of the shell, it gave time for speculation as to what
was the enemy's objective. The shell fell about fifty
yards short of the water-boat, and was followed
immediately by another which straddled her, pitching
about the same distance over. On this, she rapidly
got under weigh and stood out to sea, followed by
a number of rounds which were ineffective.</p>

<p>By this time we were close into Anzac beach, and
had anchored preparatory to a picket-boat coming off
to take our mails, etc. Four other trawlers lay close
to us engaged on various duties. The Turks being
baulked of their first quarry, now turned their attention
to us, and it must be said that nothing is much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>more unpleasant than to be confined in a very small
vessel at anchor with no protection but the thinnest
sheet-iron. Their first shot at us was shrapnel, and
the range not bad. Shrapnel is, I think, the most
spiteful sounding of all shells. The sharp report of
the shell burst, followed by a kind of metallic whistle
as the numerous bullets tear through space, being
very unpleasant. However, after this trial-shot the
enemy turned to high explosives, and one's feelings
gravitated between hope that they would not hit us
and wonder that they didn't. Some of them were
certainly closer than I cared for, but having a camera
and a feeling that, after all, things were very much in
the hands of Allah, I thought the moment seemed
opportune for a photograph. Being on the bridge at
the time, I held my camera ready and was almost
immediately rewarded by a high explosive pitching
about thirty yards over us on the port side. There
was no time to look in the finder, as the column of
water thrown up by a shell subsides very quickly,
so I simply pointed the camera at the spot, in the
hope that somewhere on the plate there might be
a result.</p>

<p>By now we were under weigh again, after handing
our mails over to the shore-boat, and the other
trawlers were heaving up their anchors. The Turks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>realising that little was to be achieved, ceased fire,
except for an occasional shrapnel to hurry us on our
way.</p>

<p>Anzac, as we left it with the morning sun right
overhead, looked a most forbidding spot. The
deep, gloomy shadows of the gullies were accentuated
by the brilliant sun lighting up each knife-edged
ridge. One could picture the scene on that morning
of April 25, when the gallant troops from Australia
and New Zealand made their wonderful landing on
this inhospitable shore.</p>

<p>Our course, after standing well out to avoid the
enemy's guns, now lay to the southward, parallel to
the shore, Helles being our next calling-place. At
this time the only parts of the peninsula occupied by
the Allies were Anzac and Helles. Seeing the great
extent of country held by the enemy, it was brought
home to one what very small holdings were ours after
months of desperate fighting. Here and there on the
way were monitors and destroyers occasionally firing
on enemy gun positions, or on any movements of
troops that could be seen. Opportunities for the
latter were rare, the nature of the ground rendering
it easy for the enemy to keep entirely out of sight.
Nearer the end of the peninsula was my own ship,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>the <i>Theseus</i>, one of the flanking ships patrolling on
the left of the troops at Helles. Shortly after we
rounded Cape Tekeh and anchored, where again a
picket-boat came alongside, bringing details for the
island of Tenedos and taking off the mails we had
brought. Meanwhile, a certain number of shells were
falling on the base camp, and occasionally an "over"
would drop among the shipping; but nothing came
near enough to worry us.</p>

<p>The base camp from the sea gave an impression
of a burnt-up waste. The long occupation had
removed every sign of vegetation, and nothing
remained but yellow sand and clouds of dust driving
seaward in the freshening breeze.</p>

<p>The place was teeming with life, apparently
oblivious of the falling shells. The whole face of the
sand-cliff was honeycombed with dug-outs and roads
cut for transport, and the beaches were covered with
the endless paraphernalia of a camp in war-time.</p>

<p>Our next place of call was Rabbit Island, to the
south of Helles. As we left the end of the peninsula,
a wonderful panorama could be obtained of the whole
position. Achi Baba loomed over all, while to the
right Seddul Bahr, the entrance to the Dardanelles,
and the Asiatic shore showed clearly. It was here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>that the disastrous attack of April 18 took place,
which showed us the futility of forcing the Narrows
without an adequate landing force acting in co-operation.</p>

<p>Our stay at Rabbit Island was short. Only one or
two ships lay there. The island itself is a barren
hummock of very small extent, and of little value
except for the special use to which it is being put.
Some ships' boats came off for fleet letters and a
few mails, after which we took our departure for
Tenedos.</p>

<p>Tenedos, one of the most flourishing of the islands
in the vicinity of the Dardanelles, is used by us and
the French as an aeroplane base. The picturesque
harbour is surrounded by quaint buildings, with an
ancient fort dominating the whole. A short stay here
completed our business. The return journey to
Helles and Kephalo was uneventful. True, our
reception at Helles was disturbed somewhat by a
6-inch shell, which fell immediately astern of us as
we were approaching our anchorage. Fortunately,
this was a solo, for, though we momentarily anticipated
the usual chorus, nothing further occurred to
disturb our peace of mind. None the less, I must
say I looked forward to an early departure; but this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>was disposed of temporarily by the arrival of a picket-boat
with orders to wait for two naval officers.
However, this only delayed us some twenty
minutes, when we took our leave of Helles, arriving
at Kephalo at dusk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="5">V</abbr><br />

<small>BEACH-PARTIES</small></h2>


<p>In the various landings in Gallipoli it naturally
came about that the Navy, after the actual disembarkation
of the troops, had a great deal of work
to do in connection with the incessant stream of
material, stores, etc., and this necessitated more or
less permanent beach-parties, composed of bluejackets
who lived and had their being with the soldiers at
the base camps. A naval captain, as beach master,
one or two lieutenants and midshipmen to run the
picket-boats, and a number of seamen ratings comprised
these parties. It was their duty to see to the
handling of the transports, landing of stores, and
the various other jobs which come natural to a sailor
where sea and shore meet. The bluejacket takes a
different view of life from the soldier. This is not
surprising, for his mode of life and training is peculiar
to the Navy. Certainly the sailors on the beaches
were generally regarded with considerable interest
by their military companions. A Major with whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>I came in contact gave me an entertaining account
of the naval camp situated close to his dug-out. It
appeared at the commencement of activities on shore
that the collecting of souvenirs, in the shape of shell-splinters,
shrapnel cases, or anything of this nature,
was greatly in vogue, and developed into something
of a fine art. As a rule, when the Turks began to
shell the beaches, every one whose occupation would
allow, dived into his dug-out and remained there
until the firing had ceased. The sailors' camp was
no exception to this; but however hot the fire, one or
more heads would invariably be seen projecting from
the entrance to the dug-out somewhat like a tortoise
looking out from his shell. An instinctive knowledge
seemed to be possessed by the owners of the
heads where a shell in flight was likely to pitch.
The moment the explosion had taken place a
number of men carrying spades would emerge from
the dug-outs, race across the sand and scrub to
the spot and begin a furious digging competition for
fragments.</p>

<p>Sailors have been trained from youth up to regard
anything and everything, from a piece of string to
a traction engine, as likely to be of use at some time
or other. Consequently their dug-outs were museums
of all the flotsam and jetsam which a military base
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>provides in war-time, and, I imagine, a good deal
which does not come into this category.</p>

<p>The Major, who seemed so entertained with the
beach-party and its doings, told me that immediately
after the Suvla Bay landing, and during the advance
on the left flank, it was his duty to take charge of a
considerable amount of unused Turkish field-gun
ammunition amounting to some 700 rounds. Now
there is probably nothing which appeals to the collector
of battlefield souvenirs so much as a complete
cartridge case and shell. This makes a beautiful
trophy when polished and gives the possessor somewhat
the same feeling as a schoolboy who obtains
a rare unused stamp which he knows to be genuine.</p>

<p>The ammunition in question was to be sent down
to the base, where instructions would be given as to
its disposal. Oddly enough, soon after arrival it
appeared to be slowly and steadily diminishing, and
reports reached the Major of dark figures having been
seen flitting about the store at night. On his return
to the base the number of shells had been reduced to
some 300, and for a long time their disappearance
was wrapped in mystery. One day, however, when
on his way to call on a brother officer, the Major's
direction lay through the beach-parties' camp. Whilst
passing one of the dug-outs he was surprised to hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>a sharp explosion and to see four sailors hurl themselves
into the open through the diminutive doorway.
One had a somewhat blackened face and very little
eyebrows or front hair, whilst the others were in
the evident enjoyment of a good joke. Inquiries
elicited the fact that the hurried exit was caused by
the premature explosion of a shell-fuse which was
being coaxed into yielding up its active properties
with the aid of a jack-knife or some similar weapon.
A closer inspection of the dug-out disclosed the
fact that amongst many other trophies of war a
considerable number of the missing shells played
a large part in the decoration of the interior. Most
of them had already undergone the aforesaid operation,
and, with charges drawn, now stood ready to
be sent home, when opportunity should offer, to
grace the parlour mantelpiece.</p>

<p>In the matter of clothes the sailors showed a
marked disinclination to wear anything provided
for them. They were supplied with khaki, as white
would be far too conspicuous; but, being ashore,
and feeling, I suppose, something of a sense of
relaxed discipline, it was almost impossible to get
them to wear the clothes served out. Consequently
you saw the strangest collection of garments being
worn in the beach-parties' camp. An order to wear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>the clothes provided would produce a return to
regulation dress for a day, or possibly two, after
which most of the men would again be wearing the
kit which suited their particular tastes. It was
found hopeless to try and enforce the rule. After
all, in a case of this kind, and under the peculiar
circumstances, it is perhaps better to indulge a
man's fancy as long as it does not affect the work
in hand and keeps him cheerful and happy.</p>

<p>A naval officer, whose duties lay on shore, told
me this story one day which I think is good enough
to relate.</p>

<p>He was outside his dug-out one afternoon and
chanced to see two men passing in strange raiment.
The combination of gait and the fact that both
were wearing navy flannels told him at once that
they were blue-jackets. Anxious to know what
their special mission might be, he stopped and
questioned them.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Motor-lighter Kâ€”, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you belong there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," (hesitating) "we've just been up to
the trenches."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>"Were you sent there with orders?"</p>

<p>"Erâ€”no, sir."</p>

<p>"How long have you been up there?"</p>

<p>"'Ow long, sir?" (then to companion) "When
was it we went up, Bill?" (indistinct murmurs from
diffident comradeâ€”then to Captain) "I should say
about four days, sir."</p>

<p>Finally the Captain ordered them down to a
picket-boat in which he was about to visit the flagship,
and they were put in the midshipman's charge
under arrest. On the way out the Captain heard
the two adventurers discussing their detention with
some bitterness, always ending with the same refrain,
which was repeated several times, thus: "Fine
thing, thisâ€”under arrest. Well I'm â€”â€”! And
they treat yer like a gentleman in the trenchesâ€”treat
yer like a gentleman, I say."</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine the point of view of men
leaving the trenches with regret.</p>

<p>I believe I am right in saying that at the original
landing at Helles many blue-jackets in charge of
the landing-parties, whose boats had been sunk by
the terrible fire, though they themselves escaped
uninjured, joined with the soldiers in the advance
on bare feet and with boat-hooks for weapons.</p>

<p>Here is an incident which came under my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>personal notice, and though not really belonging to
this chapter on beach-parties is nevertheless indirectly
connected with the subject. It serves to illustrate
the humorous spirit obtaining in the fleet, and
occurred on a ship to which I was attached for
some time. Our gunner, a man who had seen a
great deal of service in almost every part of the world,
was blessed with a large sense of the ridiculous.
Now, the ship's carpenter seemed to possess an
extraordinary attraction for shells, inasmuch as in
whatever part of the ship he happened to be when
we were under fire a shell invariably seemed to
arrive in his close vicinity. This had happened so
often that it got on his nerves. It occurred to the
gunner that the shining hour might be improved
by a little gentle attention on his part. It must be
understood that what he did was done entirely to
amuse himself and not from a wish to play to the
gallery. One day, when several shells had fallen
near us and to which we were not replying at the
time, he ensconced himself behind an iron door
leading from the battery on to the quarter-deck,
which door was standing open at right angles to
the doorway itself. Having provided himself with
an iron bar, he kept vigil there in the hope that an
occasion might arise which would take the carpenter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>past his hiding-place. His wait, though long, was
not unrewarded. The unwary carpenter came along
the battery and out on to the quarter-deck, and at
the moment of passing the gunner the latter delivered
a tremendous blow on his own side of the iron door
with the bar. The effect on the carpenter exceeded
the gunner's wildest dreams, and caused infinite
amusement amongst those of us who witnessed the
incident, for we had been wondering what could be
the meaning of the gunner's manÅ“uvres.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="6">VI</abbr><br />

<small>SUBMARINES</small></h2>


<p>It is, of course, a debatable point in this war, the
first in which submarines have played a large part,
to what extent they have justified their existence.
Certain it is that as a moral force they are in a very
strong position. Our own main battle-fleets have
had to take very complete measures for protection
against this form of attack. Any excursions to sea
must always be done at high speed with an advance
guard of destroyers and other light craft, though
there is consolation in the fact that the fleet of the
enemy have chosen to remain in more or less land-locked
harbours with elaborate boomed defences. At
the same time it is certain that the war at sea cannot
be brought to a final end by the submarine, but must
eventually be settled by the Capital ship.</p>

<p>The German submarines have had greater opportunities
of paring down our Navy than we theirs.
This applies especially to the early days of the war,
when, owing to the total unexpectedness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>upheaval, before experience had taught us how to
deal with these unseen craft, they failed entirely to
achieve anything that caused us alarm from a military
standpoint. A few ancient cruisers fell to them, three
of which, the <i>Aboukir</i>, the <i>Hogue</i>, and the <i>Cressy</i>,
were so destroyed while indulging in a perfectly
human desire to save life. All the ships so sunk
were easy targets owing to slow speed. So far not
one really fast modern vessel has been sunk by this
form of attack.</p>

<p>If it could ever be known, which I fear is impossible,
how many torpedoes have been fired at warships
without taking effect (and the number is large), it
would only go to show the difficulties encountered by
the submarine and the immunity of the fast vessel.
Add to this the large number of enemy submarines
destroyed, nearly all by means evolved since war
began (a period notoriously difficult in which to carry
out experiments), and it is only reasonable to presume
that, when times of peace come again, it will not be
long before means are arrived at which will render
surface vessels almost entirely immune from this
form of attack.</p>

<p>Everyone is agreed that one of the brightest spots
in our campaign in the Dardanelles has been supplied
by the British submarines. If there are still people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>at home who ask what the Navy is doing, one can
point to these vessels as an example of what the
whole Navy would do had they any scope in which
to exercise their activities.</p>

<p>But we are dealing with an enemy who feels
that he has nothing to gain and everything to lose
by seeking an engagement. The impossibility of
forcing his stronghold must be obvious to the least
enlightened.</p>

<p>Our submarines out here have penetrated what
most naval men would have declared to be an impassable
barrier until it became an achieved fact.
Think of the obstacles their crews have surmounted:
rows of mines susceptible to the lightest touch, nets
completely across the Narrows, and last, but not
least, a strong current flowing seawards. Only then
can you begin to realise the difficulties and dangers
in endeavouring to gain an entrance into the Sea of
Marmora and the main sea route for the Turkish
water-borne supplies. The following signal, typical
of many others, "Eâ€” arrived in Sea of Marmora
without trouble, torpedoed a steamer in False Bay
on her way," furnishes an indication that these
desperate ventures are undertaken as a matter of
course.</p>

<p>I met Commander Nasmith one afternoon at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Kephalo. He had just returned from an aeroplane
flight up the Narrows after an investigation of the
net defence placed across at that point to prevent
submarines from penetrating into the Sea of Marmora.
He did not seem very much impressed, and
his judgment was justified next day when he took
E11 through the defences and arrived in Marmora
without mishap. The train-like regularity with which
our submarines have accomplished this task is apt
to make the venture appear commonplace to the
newspaper reader, who may imagine that there is
some easy road which, when once found, is plain-sailing.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Every submarine that goes up does so with the
full knowledge of the dangers to be faced, and the
occasional loss of one of them shows the perils
incurred.</p>

<p>In the early stages of the operations the net
across the Narrows could be negotiated by diving
under it; but, on a subsequent occasion, a submarine
returning to the open sea found that the Turks had
placed a deeper net in position. This particular
submarine fouled the net at a depth of over one
hundred feet, and was actually hung up by stout
wire for upwards of fifteen minutes. It is impossible
to imagine anything more likely to unnerve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>men than to be caught like herrings in a net below
the surface, and actually to hear, as they did, hydrostatic
bombs exploding around them. The Turks
would know, of course, by the agitation of the net
above, that a submarine was caught; however, by
going astern and then ahead, and allowing her whole
weight to come on the net, the vessel broke through
and returned in safety.</p>

<p>Many of our submarines after penetrating to the
Sea of Marmora have made protracted stays of
twenty-eight to thirty days, which is the more
astonishing when one realises the cramped conditions
and general discomfort when living on one of these
boats for any length of time. I think it may be
said that the Turks have ceased to regard the sea
route as a means of supplying their troops with any
degree of safety, the number of transports sunk being
very large, including war vessels. One of the most
successful pieces of work accomplished at the time
of the Suvla Bay landing was the sinking of the
<i>Kaiserin Barbarossa</i> by a British submarine. This
ship had formerly belonged to Germany, but was
purchased from them by Turkey. She was sent
down from Constantinople to take position off Gallipoli
or thereabouts with a view to indirect fire over
the land with her 11-inch guns, of which she possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>eight. She was also reported to be carrying
large quantities of ammunition for the land forces.
One can well imagine, therefore, the enthusiasm
with which the signal of her sinking was received.
Undoubtedly our ships and land-force thus escaped
what might have been a severe menace, while the
effect on the enemy was evidently salutary, as no
further attempt was made to dispatch a war vessel
with guns of heavy calibre to co-operate with their
army.</p>

<p>Possibly at some future time a fuller description
may be written when all the facts become known of
the adventures of our submarines in this inland sea.
These should certainly supply the historian with
some of the most romantic episodes of the war.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="7">VII</abbr><br />

<small>WOUNDED</small></h2>


<p>The handling of wounded in the Dardanelles
has been a difficult proposition, which the nature
of the country has not tended to lessen. The injured
men have to be taken off the shore by small boats
and then transferred to hospital ships.</p>

<p>These ships are obliged to lie off some distance
clear of rifle-bullets and shell-fire. Even then,
several cases have occurred of men already wounded
receiving further injury through stray shots reaching
the ships.</p>

<p>A patient was sitting on his cot preparatory to
turning in, when a bullet entered the open port and
passing through two thicknesses of his pyjamas,
buried itself in the deck. A nursing sister standing
near at the time was relieved to see the man laughing
and holding out his coat for her to examine. These
occasional missiles were not fired intentionally at
the hospital ships, but came over from trenches
running parallel to the shore.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>In most cases the ships lay out a mile or more.
The first batch of wounded I saw came off after
the landing at Suvla Bay. They arrived alongside
us in a ship's barge towed by a picket-boat. They
had been wounded during the night, and presented
a sad spectacle, lying in the boat in every conceivable
attitude with bandages through which the blood
was soaking. Some of them were oblivious of
everything, and wore a pathetically dazed look.
Others not so badly injured seemed mildly interested
in events around them, while the still lighter cases
waved to us and appeared quite cheerful. The
lightly wounded soldier is probably the happiest
of all. He is out of the inferno of battle and is
fairly certain of return to health and strength.</p>

<p>Those wounded among the first parties landed
on an enemy's coast are, generally speaking, bound
to undergo the greatest hardships. This specially
applies to the Dardanelles. At Suvla Bay the
suffering caused was added to by the shortage of
water. The shore to which the wounded were
brought was entirely devoid of shade, and the blazing
sand was intensified by the heat of the sun.
Operations on serious cases were performed with
the greatest difficulty, and the shallow water close
inshore made it impossible for the steam-cutters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>to bring their tows of boats very near. The tows
had, therefore, to be rowed to the beach by three
or four sailors; the wounded were placed in them
and rowed off again to the cutters.</p>

<p>An undertaking of this kind takes some considerable
time when large numbers of sufferers are continually
arriving. Consequently the dressing stations
rapidly became congested, and it was some days
before matters could be reduced to smooth working.</p>

<p>As soon as sufficient material had arrived, pontoon
piers were built to allow the steam cutters to come
right alongside.</p>

<p>The drinking-water difficulty was remedied to a
large extent a day or two after the landing. War
vessels in the harbour using their distilling plants
were able to cope with the demand. Lighters, boats
with canvas tanks, and in fact anything that would
hold water were requisitioned.</p>

<p>These were towed as close inshore as the depth
would allow, and connected with the beach by
pipes. Each lighter carried a portable fire-engine
for pumping purposes. This supply greatly alleviated
the sufferings of the wounded. A severely injured
man may be deadened to a sense of bodily pain, but
thirst, which is scarcely ever absent, is the hardest
to bear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p>The amount of sickness among the troops in the
Dardanelles far exceeds in proportion that of any
other theatre of war. The reasons are not far to
seek: want of proper rest, lack of really good water,
and, worst of all, innumerable flies. This latter pest
is the cause of much sickness, and is a most difficult
problem to deal with. One must also take into
account the intermittent shell-fire on the bases.
This, while it tries the strongest nerves, at the same
time tends, through custom, to make men regardless
of danger.</p>

<p>A large number of hospital ships are naturally
required to carry the sick and wounded. As far
as can possibly be arranged, one of them is always
lying off each base, so that immediately a ship is
filled and proceeds to her destination her place is
taken by another.</p>

<p>The carrying capacity of each vessel varies, though
the smaller ones can accommodate even between two
and three hundred; the mighty <i>Aquitania</i>, however,
takes as many as four thousand.</p>

<p>Most of the light cases are conveyed to the islands
of Mudros and Lemnos, while the serious ones are
taken to England.</p>

<p>The most touching sights are the small cemeteries
dotted about near the shore. On each grave is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>rough wooden cross, erected by loving comrades, and
bearing the name and regiment of the dead hero.
There seemed to me to be something infinitely sad
at the thought of these men, who had given their all,
sleeping a last sleep so far from the country they
loved.</p>
